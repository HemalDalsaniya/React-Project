        "Koala sofa bed is excellent quality. We keep it in our home office as a sofa however we have had guests sleep on it and they said it was extremely comfortable.",
        "The New Koala Mattress is amazing and exceeded all my expectations. I love how easy it is to change the comfort layer, our personal fave is the medium-firm support.",
        "I love EVERYTHING about this couch. Itâ€™s beautiful, the fabric is wonderful and cleans so well with either a soapy wipe or the Bissell. It was so easy to assemble and do by myself.",
        "Delivery was so quick, it was easy to set up and the mattress itself is so comfortable. Stoked not to be woken up every time hubby rolls over!!!",
        "We are very happy with this couch, it came in a timely manner, was super easy to put together and looks fantastic. I love that we can wash the covers too, with small kids at home, this comes in handy.",
        "This is the perfect addition to our home office / guest room. It has exceeded our expectations aesthetically as well as comfort levels. We are so happy with our purchase!",
        "Such a simple ordering, delivery and setup experience, and have been sleeping better than I have in years from the very first night.",
        "We absolutely love our Balmain Bed Base! It was incredibly easy to put together, and is so solid. Koala has restored our faith in bed frames that are supportive, minimalist and aesthetically pleasing.",
